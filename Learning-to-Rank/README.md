# Project 2: Learning to Rank

1. Baseline: Supervised Ranking:

Methods: MART, LambdaMart implementation from RankLib https://sourceforge.net/projects/lemur/files/lemur/RankLib-2.9/  

2. Feature engineering or Representation learning to improve on baseline:

Exploit page similarity and/or domain or other meta-information link structure data provided to improve ranking over the baseline. 
Implement either option A or option B:
   Option A: train a fully connected NN or CNN using Tensorflow or Pytorch to try to "discover" additional features
   Option B: manually engineer additional useful features, and use existing RankLib implementation of MART
   
 3. Data:

 MQ2007, MQ2008
